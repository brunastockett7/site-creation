This is a Node.js web application I built as part of a course assignment to practice building a full web app from start to finish.

It includes a backend server, views, public assets, and database logic, all organized in a way that makes the project easy to understand and work on.

Uses views to render pages

Serves static files (CSS, JS, images)

Connects to a database

Handles basic backend logic for a website

Why I built this

This project helped me understand how backend and frontend work together in a real web application.
It was a great way to practice structuring a project, working with views, and managing server logic.
